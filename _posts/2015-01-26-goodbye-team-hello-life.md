Last day of work today. It's over. I quit my job. I actually quit my job.

> What the hell do I do now?!?!?

Guess I better get a life.

But first!

# Take-aways from my last day:

Oh man... people at this company really do not like working for the owner. So. Many. People. are offerring to leave with me. 

I encourage them to stay, they say "I don't think this is a dream job any more". I say I'm working on my own thing, they want to collaborate. The owner's personal assistant asked to come with. The CEO offerred to help and sign an NDA.

These are really amazing people. And just like me... they know that working for this owner sucks. We get to do great work... but are just beaten down until we break!!

# Building a company

It's going to take me a while... But I can build this. I don't know exactly how, but I know I can. It's just people. I need to make a plan, get out there, and convince a lot of people.

I can do that.

# Tonight

I'm trying to learn to have fun first. Take care of myself. I want to socialize.

I'm just going to get out and explore. There's a comedy show tonight. I'll start by heading to that. :)
