So here I am in a very exciting place. It feels like I've filed for identity bankruptcy.

In the last 6 months, I have:

* Left my religion (deconverted from Christianity)
* Filed for divorce
* Moved to a city where I have only 1 friend (San Francisco)
* Quit my job (which was online)

I came to a place where I realized that many of the decisions I made in my life, I made to satisfy my constructed idea of what "other people" wanted.

But... surprise! Other people don't care very much what I am. Or what I do. As long as I don't come and bother them in their lives.

So here it is. I'm rebuilding a completely new identity from scratch. No one knows me. No one cares who I am or what I do.

There is no one left to please.

Everything is completely new starting now.
